I understand the fascination with data visualisation now. This morning my colleague showed me what he was doing with some of the data we had gathered from the general election and - I can't lie - I got a bit excited over it. 

As a result I've spent the afternoon playing with D3 and the raw data, and I've learned some useful things. Sadly I can't share any code with you, as the data it relies on is owned by the BBC and I can't republish it (by design D3 requires a publically accessible JSON file to work from). But I can share a screenshot of what I quickly made with D3 and the election data.

It's interesting to see consider the adage that "[Tories always vote](https://twitter.com/EmmaKennedy/status/596478834788044802)" when looking at this scatter graph. Yes, yes,  know that this doesn't necessarially prove that Tories always vote. But it certainly shows that voter turnout is much higher in constituencies where Tories win.
