I love me some podcasts. I travel everywhere by bicycle and I need something to keep my brain occupied while I do so, so I queue up some podcasts and have them ready to go whenever I get on my bike - my earphones and phone are always in my pocket.

Podcasts are vital for me, as I don't tend to read blogs or read Twitter that often, so I easily miss out on the latest news and trends in the FED world.

## Shoptalk show
- <http://shoptalkshow.com/>
- Presented by [Dave Rupert](https://twitter.com/davatron5000) and [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier).

I'm not sure how Dave and Chris manage to churn this show out, but every week a new 1 hour show emerges, and it's always something to look forward to. Sometimes the shows are centered on special guests and a particular topic, while others are rapid fire shows, where they answer questions on FED tech, process and business sent in by listeners.

It's always a pleasure to listen to and _always_ informative, and it has been wonderful to see Dave and Chris grow and learn about issues of diversity and intersectionality. When you hear a show that used to feature macho machine-gun noises and dude jokes now ask for show donations to be made to [Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/), you know progress in this industry is possible.

## Toolsday
- <http://www.toolsday.io/>
- Presented by [Una Kravets](https://twitter.com/Una) and [Chris Dhanaraj](https://twitter.com/chrisdhanaraj).

You're greeted at the start of every episode by Una singing about FED. This is a _good_ thing. Una and Chris spend each 20 minute show covering topics surrounding the technical side of FED. So one episode might be ES2015, while another might discuss standards and linters. Definitely a good one for getting up to speed on the (sometimes frustratingly) broad topics that make up FED.

## TTL
- <http://ttlpodcast.com/>
- Presented by [Rebecca Murphey](https://twitter.com/rmurphey).

I've just started listening to this, and I'm already hooked. Between 40 minutes and an hour long, this show has Rebecca talking to a guest about their area of expertise and the work that they do. This results in excellent insider secrets and tips being unearthed in every episode.

## Style Guide Podcast
- <http://styleguides.io/podcast>
- Presented by [Anna Debenham](https://twitter.com/anna_debenham) and [Brad Frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost).

The Style Guide Podcast is pretty heavy, dealing with the process and business angles of building and maintaining company-wide style guides. But set aside an hour to listen to the show and you'll get some valuable insights into maintaining style guides and pattern libraries at scale.

## Responsive Design Podcast
- <http://responsivedesign.is/podcast>
- Presented by [Justin Avery](https://twitter.com/justinavery).

Coming out every 2 - 4 weeks, Justin's show is a great way of keeping up with trends in the web industry. Each show is highly variable in length and content, but it's always informative.

## 99 Percent Invisible
- <http://99percentinvisible.org/>
- Presented by [Roman Mars](https://twitter.com/romanmars).

Not actually FED, but this is a podcast that delivers delicious 20 minute chunks about the design that we miss in our everyday lives.

## Responsive Web Design
- <http://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/>
- Presented by [Karen McGrane](https://twitter.com/karenmcgrane) and [Ethan Marcotte](https://twitter.com/beep).

Karen and Ethan spend around 20 minutes each episode talking to the people who make responsive web designs happen. While some of us might take RWD to be a given now, it is still being rolled our in large organisations and in big corporate redesigns. This show gives some great insights into the people and tech processes behind this.


So there you go. Check them out in your podcatcher of choice.

Incidentally, while I'd never try to simultaneously ride a bicycle and listen to anything while cycling in London, because you need 100% of your wits about you due to the Daily Mail-reading, hate-filled, HGV drivers *literally* trying to kill you, I have no problem doing so in Berlin.

Berlin is, in every aspect bar queueing (where it is 100% German), utterly chill. So while I wait at lights, avoid pedestrians in the cycle lanes, and am busy getting shaken to death on Berlin's randomly cobbled streets, I probably have one of these shows playing in a solitary ear.
