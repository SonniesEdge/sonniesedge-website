In a big move for me, I've started writing articles for <a href="http://sitepoint.com">Sitepoint.com</a>. My first featured piece is <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/migrating-team-sass/">Migrating a Team to Sass</a>, where I talk about... migrating a team to Sass. (There are no surprises in that title).

It's really nice to see it linked up via<a href="http://css-weekly.com/issue-138/">CSS Weekly</a>, <a href="http://lullabot.com">Lullabot</a>'s <a href="http://tinyletter.com/front-end-rapport/letters/front-end-rapport-21">Front-end Rapport</a> and the always lovely <a href="http://sassnews.com">SassNews</a>.

Here's to more writing! :D
