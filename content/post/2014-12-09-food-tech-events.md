You've never noticed the food at tech events.

No seriously, you haven't. Not unless you've got some kind of dietary restriction.

It's always pizza that's served. Always.\* It's really frustrating to see pizza lying around everywhere, and knowing that as one of those special-snowflake coeliacs, you can't eat any of it. (As I type this, my stomach is growling as the smell of hot pizza wafts under my nostrils). 

At least there's normally vegetarian stuff around. Even if it's only margherita, in case vegetables scare the carnivores.

I'm not asking for a 100% wheat-free, vegetarian, vegan, halal and fruitarian smorgasbord. But how about trying something different? Tacos, or sushi maybe? 

 \* Actually, I lie - [LDN Sass](https://twitter.com/ldn_sass) did provide mexican food.
