I've just pushed a commit to my site that will remove Google Analytics tracking for good.

It was just 4 or 5 lines of code, but it represented me being compilict in the tracking of you, the beautiful person reading this, as you moved across the web.

Google Analytics is in the same breed of tracking software as Facebook, something that I'm vehmently against. Why would I allow one of those things on my site, but not the other, when they do exactly the same intrusive spying task?

In fact, in rank hypocricy, I disable all loading of Google Analytics whenever I visit a web page. Why should I allow it for you, but disable it for me?

Google Analytics has always been a bit of a self-validation crutch. "Look how many visits I'm getting ma!" It doesn't really serve a _purpose_. I design my site for everybody, so I don't need to track where people are coming from. I design my site for every device, so I don't need to track OS and Browser. I have zero interest in the awfully revealing demographic data that GA exposes. 

So goodbye Google Analytics. It was good while it lasted.
