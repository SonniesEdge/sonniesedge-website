I've now given this talk at a few international conferences. I suspect it's one of the most uncomfortable - or antagonistic - talks that a modern web developer can hear. 

## History of the Web

I'm here to talk to you about the single biggest invention in human history. Care to guess what that is? Some might might say that invention is fire, or language, or beer (actually, maybe it is beer). Some might say it's the invention of electricity, or THE MASTERING OF THE ATOM. Some others, more aware of the topic of this site, might say that it's the Internet (lower or uppercase "I"). But no, the intro of this talk is about the invention of the World Wide Web. The Dub Dub Dub. Or, as we all just call it in the mid 2010's - the Web. 

### Not a single invention

It's important to realise that the Web wasn't just a single sudden invention, without portent or precedent. We know that one man invented it, yes (thanks Tim!), but he did so on the back of a thousand other technologies, inspired and enabled to build by their previous work. 

The Web is increadible. It's increadible because it's stuipid. Yup, you heard me. In fact, it's made of stupid - or more accurately, at its core it is a collection of very dumb, very _simple_, technologies, chained together to make something much greater. 

Let's take a - very simplified! - look at the history of the Web, and the simple technologies that allowed it to be built. And because we don't want to be going back to Mog hitting Gog over the head with a handy stone, and proclaiming this little patch of sand HIS (inadvertandly inventing the first nation state) we're just going to concentrate on the last 100 years.

Oh, and let's credit Jeremy Keith with the notion of the web as a evolutionary product, rather than a single invention - his talks on this topic are fascinating, and far more detailed than anything here. 

### Telegraphs

Telegraphs. These things completely changed the face of the planet. A simple electrified wire, down which was sent simple beep beep beep messages. Before the invention of the telegraph, messages to even the nearest territory would take days. Messages to another country would take weeks, messages to another _continent_ would take months. 

With the invention of telegraphs even the trans-continental message deliveries suddenly came down to _seconds_. Months -> Seconds. Whoah! 

### Telephones

With the invention of telegraphs we had the cultural idea of messaging-at-a-distance-via-electricity. It wasn't too soon before the same kinda lines were being used to transmit voices. Add a paper cone with a pickup, add another paper cone with a wee magnet, replicate that at the other end, and you were suddenly able to talk to people thousands of kilometers away. 

### Primitive computer networking

Soon after telephones become commonplace we saw the rise of computers. Almost straight away w]people thought about getting them to talk to each other. This led to the invention of the modem, which as you can see in the slide, was at first a bulky device that you placed your phone speaker and microphone into. The computer would then scream down the phone to another computer, who would happily scream back, singing the song of their people. Computers could now talk to each other! Oh my. 

### Standardised computer networking

But bespoke one-on-one chat wasn't enough for computers. No, they wanted group chats. Within a few years of the first modems the industry had
