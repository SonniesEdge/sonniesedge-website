<h2>History of the Web</h2>
<p>I'm here to talk to you about the single biggest invention in human history. Some might might say that invention is fire, or language. Some might say that it's the printing press, or beer (actually, maybe it is beer). Some might say it's the invention of electricity, or THE MASTERING OF THE ATOM. 

<p>Some others, perhaps less drunk on beer and easily accessible literature, might say that it's the Internet (lower or uppercase "I"). But no, the this talk is about the invention of the World Wide Web. The good old Dub Dub Dub. Or, as we all just call it in the late 2010's - the Web. </p>

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Not a single invention</h3>
<p>Despite what Tim Berners-Lee claims, the Web wasn't a single invention [1]. Yes, we know that one man _says_ that he invented it (grudging thanks to Tim), but he did so on the back of a thousand other technologies, inspired and enabled to build by their previous work. 
<p>The Web is incredible. It's incredible because it's stupid. It's a collection of very stupid, or more accurately, very _simple_, technologies, all chained together to make something much greater.[2] 
<p>Let's take a - very simplified! (and possibly horrendously simplified) - look at the history of the Web, and the simple technologies that allowed it to be built. Oh, and because we don't want to be going all the way back to Mog hitting Gog over the head with a handy stone, and proclaiming that little patch of sand HIS (inadvertently inventing the first nation state) we're just going to concentrate on the last 100 years.

<p>[1]I am totally joking and fully accept Tim's world-changing single-person invention.
<p>[2]All credit to Jeremy Keith for this notion of the web as a evolutionary product, rather than a single invention - his talks on this topic are fascinating, and far more detailed than anything here.

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Telegraphs</h3>
<p>Telegraphs. These things completely changed the face of the planet. A simple electrified wire, 
down which was sent simple beep beep beep messages. Before the invention of the telegraph, messages 
to even the nearest territory would take days. Messages to another country would take weeks, 
messages to another _continent_ would take months. 

<p>With the invention of telegraphs even the trans-continental message deliveries suddenly came 
down to _seconds_. Months -> Seconds. Whoah!

<h3>Telephones</h3>
<p>With the invention of telegraphs we had the cultural idea of 
messaging-at-a-distance-via-electricity. It wasn't too soon before the same kinda lines were being 
used to transmit voices. Add a paper cone with a pickup, add another paper cone with a wee magnet, 
replicate that at the other end, and you were suddenly able to talk to people thousands of 
kilometers away.

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Primitive computer networking</h3>
<p>Soon after telephones become commonplace we saw the rise of computers. Almost straight away 
people thought about getting them to talk to each other. This led to the invention of the modem, 
which as you can see in the slide, was at first a bulky device that you placed your phone speaker 
and microphone into. The computer would then scream down the phone to another computer, who would 
happily scream back, singing the song of their people. Computers could now talk to each other! 
<p>Oh my.

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3> Standardised computer networking</h3>
<p>But bespoke one-on-one chat wasn't enough for computers. No, they wanted group chats. Within a few years of the first modems the industry had standardised and now we had a routine set of modem commands that allowed any computer to talk to any other computer. This was the [Age of the BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system).
<p>The TCP/IP specification, incidentally, gave us Postel's Law, possibly one of the most beautiful Laws ever: 
<blockquote>“Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.”</blockquote>
<p>Applicable to so many areas of life, no?

<p>Of course, we needed to be able to look for things now that we had ways of talking on the Internet. Some clever boffin came up with the Domain Name System, while another figured out Email Addresses.

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h2>The WWW is strong</h2>
<p>So why do I mention all these things? Well, I really want to get the point across that the web is **strong**. Enormously, strong. And we rarely stop to think about how amazing this is! It's strong because of these simple, dumb technologies that it is built upon.

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>HTML is ~~a bit suggestive~~ declarative</h3>
<p>Especially HTML. Mainly because it is a simple, declarative language. It requests things from the browser. Flirts with it. It doesn't _demand_, like other languages might. No it requests. And most often it gets.

<h3>Robust</h3>
<p>And this flirty declarative nature makes HTML increadibly robust. Just look here. The video above is of me pulling chunks out of the Amazon DE homepage as I browse it.
<p>Let's just stop and think about that. I'm pulling chunks of code out of a running application, AND IT IS STILL WORKING. 
<p>How... INCREDIBLE is that? Can you imagine pulling random chunks of code out of your iPhone or Windows laptop, and still expecting it to work? No, of course not. But with HTML, it's a given.

<h2>The WWW is everywhere</h2>
<p>It is this... _robustness_ of HTML that has made the WWW so increadibly durable. It's why it dominates the planet. A strict language would have broken 100% in the conditions that HTML was born and raised in . But HTML is utterly flexible, and survived.

<p>Some of you younger folk might not remember it, but the web at one point got split between two browsers: Netscape 4.7 and Internet Explorer 5. People proudly added badges saying "Best viewed with [XYZ] browser", and they didn't have any shame about it. Devs had to build two versions of their site, just so that users of either browser would have an indentical experience.

<h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
<p>But then history restarted. And the restart came from an unexpected direction.
<p>Because... the first iPhone appeared. While it wasn't the first smartphone by any means, it was certainly the first _popular_ smartphone. It completely changed the landscape of the Web. 
<p>It was our first great lesson in diversity.

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Lessons in Diversity</h3>
<p>Because before that we had effectively assumed one of two browsers, on the desktop, using a mouse (and _maybe_ a keyboard). Suddenly we had to deal with a new browser (Safari for iOS), a new screen ratio (portrait, rather than landscape), a new screen size (just 320px across!), a new input interface (touchscreen, rather than a mouse), and everyting else that went with using a site on a mobile device.

<p>We _had_ to learn about diversity. We were forced to. Maybe not for the right reasons - we did it because we didn't want to miss out on the market opportunity that mobile devices represented - but certainly with the right effect: we didn't want to exclude people!

<p>Okay, this is another of my Simplistic Explanations. But I'm good at them, no?

<h3>The Progressively Enhanced Pyramid of Robustness</h3>

<p>This is a period of time that gave us incredibly robust websites. It was a period when we made the separation of concerns a reality. 

<p>The Pyramid of Robustness (&copy; C Owen Enterprises Ltd) was a thing that we cared about. We put the things that were the most solid and reliable at the bottom of the pyramid - in this case server-generated HTML. We then added on a presentation layer, and then an interaction layer. The pyramid ends up with those thigns that are most fragile, and least _essential to the user_ nearer the top. The fragile things don't take the weight of things above, as we acknowledged that, well, you don't place the table on top of the delicate vase.

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Multi megabyte average</h3>
<p>We have got to the point where sites require ~2.5 megabytes to download. 

<p>Most of this is due to sites not offering srcset variants on their images, and not taking the time to optimise images on those that they do offer. Some of it is due to third-party tracking, advertising, and marketing scripts (marketeers may well be the most script-heavy people in any organisation). A lot of it due to JS application bundles and third party scripts used to run a page (such as jQuery - still a major force on most of the web).

<p>But you might make a phhffftttt noise about a mere 2.5mb.

<p>Instead of HTML being delivered from the server, a JS bundle is sent to the client, which then decompresses and intialises and the requests data, which is then sent from the server (or another server, as now everything is a service) as JSON, where it is then converted on the fly into HTML.

It's incredible that you've somehow squeezed it into your garage, and that you get into it every morning, and taxi out onto the road, and then thunder down your side street until you reach takeoff speed, and then you swoop up up up! into the sky, where you circle for a while until you find a spot at your company car park 2km away, and you then set it down, somehow, magically, into the parking space.

<p>Wouldn't it have been better, in every conceivable practical and financial way, to _buy a fucking bicycle_?
<p>Yes, it's technically amazing to build your 747, or have your JS build a content page, but it's utterly over-engineered and impractical for most occasions. 
<p>JavaScript only when there's no other choice. It shouldn't be the first port of call for building a site.

<p>Sites are no longer robust! Sites that used to be resilient and tough now die easily.

Yes it's totally valid, and their right as a user).
<p>All of these things can cause a JS-dependent site to fall over and die, 100%. A site that should be robust in the face of all these things, because of the declarative and flexible nature of HTML and CSS, is now fragile and brittle.

<p>Maybe this is in response to something else, maybe it's the case. I don't know. 

<p>And don't get me wrong on this. I use these things every single day. In my day job I write modularised JavaScript in ES6. I publish npm packages and worry about state management.

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Suddenly exclusionary</h3>
<p>This means we’re back to building sites that are not for everyone. We have started to explicetly say "I think you should have this level of tech, processing power, and bandwidth before I think you're eligable to use my site".
<p>Why? Because we want to have our fun with technology. Because we don't want to think about "edge case" user needs. 
<p>"Edge case" is, to be frank, a phrase that should be banned from all developer conversations. When we say "Edge Case" we mean "Stress Case". In their book Design for Real Life Eric Meyer & Sara Wachter-Boettcher point out that what we call an edge case is in fact an enormously stressful event for a user. It often accompanies high emotions, stress, physical problems, financial problems, etc. To me,wWhen we discount and dismiss the "edge case", we're actually saying "I don't care about that user". 

<p>An succinct example that I saw on Twitter a few months ago was an American trying to use an airline website while holidaying in SE Asia. Their flight had been cancelled and they were trying to rebook. However, due to terrible internet connectivity in their location the site just wasn't loading - it was trying to pull down huge amounts of images and JS that were not loading on that connection.


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/webperf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#webperf</a> in Cambodia: Yesterday I tried to book a domestic flight through various booking platforms and airline sites.

<p>Now imagine if that user had been able to disable Javascript and just have the HTML delivered. It wouldn't have been pretty, but it would have _worked_. But no, it turns out you can't. The website is fully JS-driven. If you disable JS then you just get a blank page. Oh, and incidentally, I looked at the offending website later - nearly 0.8MB of JS and 2.4MB of images were forced down the pipe to the browser.

<h2>Lessons in Humanity</h2>

<p>If we want to make the web better for people then the most fundamental thing that we can do is to learn the basics. Not of technology, but of our fellow humans.

<p>Because, as we've show earlier, empathy is the most important skill that a developer can have.

<p>Our job is 100% about people, our fellow humans. How can we do an amazing job for them if we don't understand who we are building for? 

<p>It's all about empathy.

<h3>Lesson 0: Empathy is a learned skill</h3>

<p>We have this notion that empathy is something that you're either born with, or you simply don't have. Because Patriarchy, and because our society tells men that they cannot feel emotion, we tend to say that empathy is a thing that only women have. 

<p>Which is of course, absolute bollocks.

<p>The truth is that empathy is a muscle, that can be exercised and made stronger. Or, to switch to antother analogy, it's a learnable skill, just like every other aspect of life. 

<p>Practise empathy every day and your ability to empathise will only get stronger!

<h3>Lesson 1: Not everyone is alike</h3>

<p>Exercising our empathy allows us to be more aware. More aware that not everyone is like us. 

<p>If you're reading this then you're likely a typical web developer: white, male, under 30 years old. 

<p>But the rest of the world isn't like you. It's beautifully, hugely, impossibly diverse! 

<p>And this diversity means that assumptions based upon only your own experiences and needs will not easily work!

<h3>Lesson 2: Not everyone is rich</h3>

<p>By being employed in this industry we are highly likely to be defined as being "well-off" compared to our peers. In comparison to the average person on this planet we are certainly defined as "rich".
<p>Yes, I know it doesn't feel like that always. This statemnt certainly doesn't account for personal cicumstance or other axises of opression (hi intersectionality!). But as a rule of thumb, it's a valid one. Techies are generally more well off than other people. 

<p>The way we just buy technology, how we will happily splurge on an Alexa or a new laptop. This is not normal compared to most people on this planet.

<p>I'm not saying this to make you feel bad. It's just something that you should bear in mind. If you ever think "ffs, why don't those users with old laptops and browsers just _upgrade_??" try and think about their circumstances. Ask "can they afford to do so?", and "will upgrading their laptop or phone mean that they can't eat this month?". 

<p>Empathy, and kindness.

<p>I've mentioned this a few times, and it is such a glossed-over part of our industry.

We have a hugely racist view that this kind of thing can only occur in rural zones of these continents.

<h3>Lesson 4: Not everyone is able-bodied, or able-minded</h3>

<p>Our final lesson. Not everyone is able-bodied, or neurotypical. 

<p>This is, like connectivity, a stereotypes issue. Able-bodied people assume that a disability manifests as a wheelchair, or maybe as a 100% blind person with a guide-dog. 

<p>But the reailty is that disabilty covers a huge gamut of issues. Yes, wheelchair users and blind people are part of that. But they do not have to be 100% a wheelchair user, nor 100% blind. Percentages exist! Disability also covers things like colour blindness, arthritis, motor control conditions such as Parkinsons or MS. It can be a neurological condition, such as ADHD, autism, or depression.
<p>There are enormous varieties of disabilities. While you do not have to have a medical knowledge of each one, you must be aware of the range.

<h2>Building with Empathy</h2>

<p>So, fantastic, you're ready to start designing with empathy!
<p>What does empathy, accessibility, performance, etc mean in practise. 
<p>Well, let me give you  a non-technical practical example.

<h3>Doorknobs</h3>

<p>Yes, doorknobs. A weird analogy, but once again, please bear with me. 
<p>Now, both of these are lovely, beautiful things (as far as doorknobs go.
<p>Both of them are made from the same materials, both of them cost the same to manufacture. 
<p>However, one of them works for all people, while the other excludes huge segments of the population. 
<p>One of them is usable by people with arthritis, people who have hand or arm amputations, or people with hand/arm injuries. The other one is completely inaccessible to anyone who hasn't got perfectly healthy arms and hands. 
<p>So, given that they both cost the same and look just as nice... why not always use the accessible version? 
<p>Similarly, when we build our websites we can build sites that are absoliutely as beautiful as any other site, but we can choose to use techniques that work for everybody, in any condition. 
<p>The users don’t see any visual difference. it's up to us to change how we build things.

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Universal case</h3>
<p>Designing for this base case helps all use cases - thinking in this way, thinking _universally_, helps all people!
<p>Not just the "obvious" cases, such as amputees, but also situations such as people carrying a baby, or having both hands full of shopping bags.
<p>Designing sites universally, designing them so that they work for people in the most stressful or hardest situations, helps people in _all_ situations. 
<p>In Microsoft's [Inclusive Design](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/design/inclusive) initiative, they sum up this perfecty:
<ul>
<li>**Recognize exclusion**.
<li>**Learn from diversity**.
<li>S**olve for one, extend to man**y - designing for people with permanent disabilities results in designs that benefit people universally. 
<li>**Constraints are beautiful**.

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Basic research</h3>

<p>So how do you start on this journey to building products that are robust and universal? 
<p>The first thing is to realise your users core journey (or journeys). On every websitem, the user is trying to accomplish _something_. Well, maybe with the exception of advertising fluff sites - my condolences if that is what you must work on. 

<p>Take, for example, a simple restaurant site. We can add sumptous photos of the food, we can add little animated waiters that march across the page, thrusting bowls of pasta into the air, while a full-screen video of the owner pleading with your to visit loads and plays in the background. 

<p>But in the end all the user wants to find out on the site is:

<ul>
<li>The address
<li>The opening times
<li>The menu options
</ul>

<p>It's same for every sector. Find our what your user needs first, then design around that. Designing anything more that that is just... pointless. 
<p>Hopefully you've got access to UX research for the product that you're building. Okay, maybe not in your average advertising design agency. But, once again, I'm sorry that that is where you must sell your labour. But everywhere else, with products that have a _purpose_, you should have that. If you don't, stop right here and go sort that out first.

<div class="comp-talk__slide"><img class="comp-talk__image" src="/images/talks/dear-developer/building-with-empathy/html.jpeg" alt=""></div>
<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>HTML</h3>

<p>Get these core journeys quickly into HTML. And I do mean _just_ HTML, delivered fresh from the server. 
<p>Test _this_ with your real users. Honestly! I know this sounds horrific to some people ("we can't show the user something _this_ low fidelity!") but this HTML will form your site! By testing the HTML, you're testing the very foundation of your Robustness Pyramid. You're testing the pure form of it. 

<p>When I say "this HTML will form your site" I mean that also. Don't treat this as prototype code. Treat it as the first iteration of your website.

<p>By designing with HTML initially you're testing how your site works on the most fundamental level. You're testing how it will work from an accessibility point of view. You're testing how it will look to screenreaders. You're testing how it will look in poor network conditions. 

<p>And you know what? This is 100% universal! Assuming you've built it using semantic HTML (and why _wouldn't_ you do that?) it will be completely accessible. 

<p>Now, let's look at a real world example, from a project I recently worked on. Please prepare yourself, there is unstyled HTML coming up.

<h3>Universal HTML</h3>

<p>That's it. Literally just HTML. It's ultra basic, biut it works on everything. 
<p>With no styling, no javascript, and even no images, there is literally nothing to fail, bar the server that generates the HTML and the network that passes it to the server. 
<p>You can build this intitial iteration using your backend language of choice. I like seeing a variety of backend languages. Diversity of technology is a great thing!
<p>Of course, there's nothing to stop you componentising everything right now. You don't have to write raw HTML files by hand to do this! Anything that can compile fragments into HTML is great. :D

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Universal CSS</h3>
<p>Now that we've created our universal HTML, let's create some universal CSS.
<p>Now, this is a tricky one. There's a few ways of approaching how you produce CSS that works for everybody. But for this example we're going to show a two-stage approach. There are other equally valid ways to do this, but I'll concentrate on the two stage for now. 

<p>This means that  you intially just add an an ultra basic stylesheet. Call this your Core stylesheet. It's barely more than styled HTML. Maybe it will add a max-width to your main content to stop it going fluid across wide screens. But no more. It's all flow content, running vertically down your page, with no positioning attempted.

<p>It still works everywhere - it's still 100% universal! 

<p>With some basic branding attached then maybe this can be tseted

<h3>What does support mean?</h3>

<p>But before we go on, a word from our sponsor, Chris Heilmann. Take a look at what he said:

<blockquote>“It’s not okay to block old browsers, but it’s a waste of time to support them 100%”</blockquote>

<p>Because you might think that what I’ve been suggesting is that we support all browsers 100% the same. Even IE6! No no no, nothing is further from the truth. I’m lazy, just like every dev. I'm not going to waste time trying to make things look the same in Firefox or Chrome as a browser that even the manufacturer has left to die in the woods. 

<p>No, the trick here is to choose a cut-off point. Especially if you are a large organisation. And the place I work - [Springer Nature](http://springernature.com) - is very fucking large.

<div class="comp-talk__slide"><img class="comp-talk__image" src="/images/talks/dear-developer/building-with-empathy/cutting-the-mustard.jpeg" alt=""></div>
<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Cutting the Mustard</h3>

<p>The BBC were pioneers in this. They developed a technique called Cutting the Mustard (CTM) for the BBC News site, which is still in use today. 
<p>They serve up a core site - basic HTML and CSS, just the same as we discussed above. 
<p>Then they then check to see what JS capabilities the browser has. It's just a few simple lines of JS. They use this as decider as to whether the browser is "core" or "advanced". 
<p>If it fails the test, then it's core, and the user is presented with a full working, but basically styled site. The styling is so simple, with no layoutout system, that it works on every browser ever made. However, if the test passes then a more advanced site is offered. It uses the same HTML and core stylesheet, but on top of that is layered another set of CSS and a large amount of display-assisting JS. 
<p>Why do this? Well, the BBC want everyone to access their site. They are a public service broadcaster and are obligated, not just by morals and business sense, but by UK legislation to produce a site that works for all. How do you combine 100% universality with the fact that some people have ancient, terrible browsers that it would be a time-sink to support? CTM gives the answer! Only those browsers that are "good enough" receive the advanced features. Those that have poor technology support silently fail the test and receive the core version. No having to support ancient browsers!

<section class="comp-talk__section">
<div class="comp-talk__slide"><img class="comp-talk__image" src="/images/talks/dear-developer/building-with-empathy/browser-support-chart.jpeg" alt=""></div>
<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Springer Nature browser support chart</h3>

<p>Springer Nature do something similiar to the BBC, but with a key difference. While the BBC do a CTM test based on JavaScript feature support, SN do a test based on a CSS media query.
<p>This media query cuts across very specific browser lines. You can see this in our [graded browser support](https://github.com/springernature/frontend-playbook/blob/master/practices/graded-browser-support.md) table. In fact, it's an exclusionary test, unlike the BBC version. It deliberately excludes those browsers marked as C-grade on our chart. 
<p>C-grade browsers receive only our core stylesheet - again, fully working, just without advanced visual styling. 
<p>Anything that isn't C-grade receives our advanced stylesheet, and a much richer visual layout. 
<p>So why do we have anything other than Grade C in our support table? Well, this is the part where being a popular site with a global audience comes in. We explicitly offer full support to those browsers that we deem as Grade A: generally the latest version -1. 
<p>Grade X... well, grade X are between grade A and C. They probably _will_ work with our advanced styling, but we can't guarantee it. 
<p>So why do we do it this way? Well, for us it's a matter of stability. Our core audience - scientific and academic researchers - like stability. By fixing our browser support we can say to them _explicitly_ what is supported and isn't supported, and route any and all bugs/complaints/weirdnesses against that support table.

<h3>Add the whizz bang</h3>

<p>Now that we have a core stylesheet and and we have an advanced stylesheet, it's time to add the lovely Javascript layer. It's the most fragile layer, so it goes last. But it has the fun aspects and the most potential to dazzle, even on a boring old scientific site. 
<p>Now is the point where we upgrade the forms so they post without doing a page refresh. Now is the time when we make pagination work without page reloads. Now is the time that we add in state management to our forms.

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Conditional JS</h3>

<p>Our CTM is done via CSS, so how do we replicate that in JS? Turns out that that there is a little-used `matchmedia` [window property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia). 
<p>It can be fed a media query directly, which is great. But even more usefully it can be fed a media query from your HTML. We therefore hook up our CTM media query to our JS via `matchMedia`.
<p>If our CTM test passes in CSS, and the CSS file loads, then our JS is loaded. Very neat, and very simple.

<p>Why do it like this? Well, we don't want our JS to even _try_ to run if it's an old browser, and we don't want it to run before our CSS, or if our CSS fails to load. Upgraded Javascript is unlikely to be useful if the associated CSS isn't there. 

<p>Once the JS is progressively loaded then we do lots of things. Add tabs, add animations, handle modal dialogs, etc. On this site the JS was relatively simple (but still modern and modularly written). But there's no reason that it couldn't be much more complex. As long as the base HTML site offers the core user journey then your JS can do lots of fancy extra things.

<p>State management solutions like Redux work perfectly well on vanilla JS sites.
<p>It won't work with something like React though, and I don’t cry about that.

<h3>Excels</h3>

<p>It excels in being robust and universal. It _always_ works. Broken JS, blocked JS, no JS, poor networks, nothing can break this, because it relies on streamed HTML, and not all-or-nothing JS. 
<p>It’s lightweight and _loves_ low powered devices. 
<p>It excels at being people-first!

<h3>What else can you do?</h3>
<p>Even if you feel that lean progressive enhancement is somehow too much to commit to, there's still plenty of things you can do to upskill your empathy and make you realise what costs there are to coding in certain ways.

<h3>3G performance</h3>

<p>An increadibly easy one is to start simulating slow network conditions in your browser. You can do this in just one tab of Chrome (other browsers will vary) by opening the Network tab in dev tools and turning on "slow 3G". Now you get to experience your site as the average person wandering around the average city does!
<p>If you're not on Chrome then try using [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/). A similar thing, but for your entire OS.

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Use real hardware</h3>

<p>If you can, test on real hardware. Your 3000€ Mac is vastly more than the average computer of most users. The iPhone X that you bought on the first day of sale is infinitely more powerful average phone that most people are making use of.
<p>Don't assume everyone has these amazingly powerful supercomputers! Make sure that your site runs well on the average Lidl laptop, because _someone_ will be using it on that, and cursing your lack of testing.
<p>Perhaps more relevant to the developer mindset - proving that your site can run on the lowest end computer means that your site will run like a bat out of hell on anything more powerful!

<h3>Listen to the web</h3>

<p>Turn on your screenreader and start navigating your sites by sound. If you're on a Mac then it's as easy as hitting `CMD + F5`. Just try it now! 

<p>There’s a learning curve, and you’ll be embarrassed at first. But if you can learn DOM or framework APIs by heart, then you can do this.

<h3>Navigate with your keyboard</h3>

<p>Similarly, start to navigate only by keyboard. I bet half of you reading this can already do this with Vim or Emacs. Using the tab and return key is an order of magnitude easier. 

<p>You will be amazed at how much better keyboard accessibility can be done when you're actually using a keyboard every day yourself.

<h2>These aren't my users!</h2>

<p>Often when I speak about these issues I hear "but these are not my users" from an indignant developer. "I don’t have users like that" he will angrily tell me, apparently knowing each and every one of the users that visit his React-powered website. 
<p>"All my users are rich young healthy people, living in metropolitan areas with excellent network coverage" they tell me, gulping furiously they do so.
<p>"These. Are. Not. My Users!"

<div class="comp-talk__text">
<h3>Yes they are</h3>

<p>I will always answer with "Yes they are!". Because, sweetpea, you simply don't know a users situation. 

<p>Oh, you can guess at it. You can assume that they're always sitting at their desk, or always on wifi, or have time to concentrate on your task.
<p>But _knowing_ what their situation is? Uh uh, sorry, you don't know that.


<p>They could be on a borrowed device. They could be using a work computer that they have no control over. They could have suffered a temporary or permanent disablity. You simply don't know! 

<p>Look at it this way: you don't just build cars that only work in the best conditions, do you? Imagine a car that only worked on a sunny day, on a flat road! Oh, how silly that would be. No, you build it so that it works in horrible weather, so that it works when driven over grass or a gravel dirt road. In the same way you don't just build sites that only work in the best conditions. 

<p>You're a web developer. Your job is to make a site work for everyone, in all conditions.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The web’s success is built on it being robust. 
<p>that robustness has made it work for everybody
<p>As a result, people all over that planet now depend on the web, for their livelihoods, for social interaction, for their health. 
<p>It means we have to defend the web for everybody. It's our job to keep it accessible and usable for all.

<h3>Keep it weird</h3>
<p>We need to keep that beauty and weirdness going that first came with the early web. 
<p>Because the webs beauty comes from its diversity. A diversity of tech, and a diversity of people. 
<p>We’re the enablers and the defenders of that diversity. 
<p>So let’s not make it about us. Let’s make it about the wonderfulness of the Weird Wild Web.
<p>Thank you.</p>
