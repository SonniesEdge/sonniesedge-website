Don't laugh, but I've been scared of horse-shaped things since a Blackpool Pleasure Beach donkey bolted with a very young and very terrified Charlie on its back.

Awww, come one. I said don't laugh.

I say "bolted", but it I seriously doubt that a donkey went out of control with me on it. I was such a wussy child that it having moved in any way at all probably had me in tears and convinced me that it was trying to kill me.

Knowing as such that I have a fear of all members of the *Equus* family, you'll appreciate what a big deal it was for me to walk up to the nearest horse riding centre and ask for a beginners lesson. 

I'm still not sure why I did it, but I'm so, so glad that I did.

Since that day in November I've come to love horse riding. I've been back every week and rode multiple horses. At the time of writing, six months have passed and I can now walk, trot (sitting and rising), canter, ride without stirrups in all gaits and jump fences at canter. I can do circles, and serpentines and can control a horse with just my lower body. Ruddy good progress for six months, I'm sure you'll agree.

Riding has been amazing for my mind and for my body, partly because I feel far more connection between my brain and my physical self, and partly because riding is massively mroe physical work than I ever thought it would be.
