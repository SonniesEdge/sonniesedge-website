<p>I collect interesting things related to the web on my Pinboard feed, and make them available here for anybody to see.</p>

<p>If you would like to follow this list directly then add <a href="https://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:sonniesedge/t:web">https://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:sonniesedge/t:web</a> to your feed reader of choice.</p>

<ul id="feed-entries">

<p>I'm really sorry, but this list of interesting articles isn't available on your browser. This is because the list of interesting things comes from an external site as XML/RSS and needs processing to show on a page. I'd normally do this via a server-side script, and show it to your via that, but because this is a freely-hosted Github Pages site, server-side scripting isn't available. Therefore this list of articles is processed client-side, in your browser, using Javascript. Which you don't have.</p>

<p>However, the XML/RSS list is directly available at <a href="https://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:sonniesedge/t:web">Pinboard</a>, where you can use your own RSS reader to look at the contents.</p>
