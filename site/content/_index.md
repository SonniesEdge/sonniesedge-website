# Back off man, I'm a web developer

Hallo, Ich hei√üe Charlie (aka sonniesedge). I'm an Ex-Britisher living and working in the beautiful city of Berlin, Deutschland. Talk to me about scifi some time. 

I pay the rent by selling my labour as a FED, where I'm ~~passionate about~~ - wait, no, stop. Stop. I absolutely despise that phrase. No, let's be honest: I'm really, REALLY, good at frontend processes and architecture, at delivering a consistent experience to all types of devices, and at generally giving a crap about the user.

I'm all about the following processes and technologies:

- User-centered experiences
- Design systems
- CSS pre- and post-processing
- Automated CSS testing
- Frontend automation
- Large-scale Sass/CSS architecture
- Adaptive web design
- Progressive enhancement
- Feel free to get in touch!
