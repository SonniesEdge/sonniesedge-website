<h1 class="c-masthead"> Back off man, I'm a web developer</h1>

<p class="c-lede">Hallo, Ich hei√üe Charlie (aka sonniesedge). I'm an Ex-Britisher living and working in the beautiful city of Berlin, Germany.</p>

<p>I'm probably that sour lesbian who once scowled at you in your local bar.</p>

<p>I pay the rent by selling my labour as a FED, where I'm <strike>passionate about</strike> - wait, no, stop. Stop. I absolutely despise the word "passion". No, let's be honest: It turns out that I'm really, REALLY good at frontend processes and architecture, at delivering a consistent experience to all types of devices, and at generally giving a crap about the user.</p>

<p>I'm all about these processes and technologies:</p>

<ul>
<li>User-centered design</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Design systems</li>
<li>Large-scale Sass/CSS architecture</li>
<li>Responsive design</li>
<li>Progressive enhancement</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of this whets your whistle, and you'd like to talk, then please feel free to get in touch!</p>
