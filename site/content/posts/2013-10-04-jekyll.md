So I've moved this site to Jekyll. As much as Drupal keeps me in employment, it's too big for my own site. Who wants to faff around with databases and .htaccess files, unless they really *really* have to?

It really reminds me of Moveable Type, which was a big blogging thing back when I first tried to work in the web world, well over a decade ago. It uses Ruby and Markdown to generate static sites, like, just HTML, that can then be deployed to a server with something as simple as FTP. No databses to worry about, no caching, no *faffing*.

As part of sniffing around all this I've been exposed to the Ruby world. Ruby seems... interesting.
